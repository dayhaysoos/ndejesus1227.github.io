			<h2>Instructions:</h3>
			<div class="instruction-row">
				<p class="instruction-p jelly-background col-md-6">1. Go ahead and put two slices of bread on the plate. Doesn't matter if you prefer whole-wheat or white bread, either way it's going to be delicious!</p>
				<img class="instruction-image col-md-6" id="step-1" src="img/step2.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="instruction-row">
				<p class="instruction-p jelly-background col-md-6">2. Let's start with opening the Jar of Jelly. Jelly is much easier to wash off of the butter knife than <span class="peanut-color">peanut butter</span>. You wanna make sure you're putting them together in the bread, not mixing them in the jars. Apply the jelly to one piece of bread, make sure you put down enough jelly so that you cover the entire slice. Think of it as coloring in a picture from a coloring book! Stay within the lines (the edge of the bread)</p>

			<div class="instruction-row">
				<p class="instruction-p jelly-background col-md-6">3. Rinse the jelly off of the butter knife at your kitchen sink or just wipe it off with a paper towel, and now we open up the jar of <span class="peanut-color">peanut butter</span>. As mentioned in step 2, make sure you cover the entire slice. Nothing is more unsatisfying than having a dry and untouched part of bread as you sink your teeth into what is supposed to be the most convenient snack ever. Don't be afraid to coat the <span class="peanut-color">peanut butter</span> on there with a thick layer.</p>

				<div class="instruction-row">
					<p class="instruction-p jelly-background col-md-6">4. You're almost done! Pick up the slice with <span class="peanut-color">peanut butter</span> on it. <span class="peanut-color">Peanut butter</span> doesn't slide off of things as easily, so you always want to flip the <span class="peanut-color">peanut butter</span> slice onto the jelly slice. When applying the <span class="peanut-color">peanut butter</span>, make sure you line it up perfectly over the jelly slice. If you don't do this perfectly you might see jelly oozing out of the sandwich (depending on how much jelly you put down). Smush the sandwich just a little bit to make sure it's really on there.</p>

						<p class="instruction-p jelly-background col-md-6">5. Cut the sandwich in half. It would be too flimsy to bring to your mouth that way. If it's in half, it maintains its composure very well. Now it's ready for you to bite into! It helps to have a glass of milk nearby to help you bring it down</p>
